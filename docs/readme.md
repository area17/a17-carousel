# A17 Carousel - Documentation

The documentation is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to compile [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates. 

To view these in a browser, visit [area17.github.io/ta17-carousel/](https://area17.github.io/a17-carousel/).

To view these locally and for local development of plugins and their documentation you will need to install a few dependencies. See [docs.github.com - building-your-site-locally](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#building-your-site-locally)

Once everything is installed, `cd` into the `docs` folder and run: 

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site should now be available in a browser at http://localhost:4000
